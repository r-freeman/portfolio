This is a living document of useful commands for maintaining and using Docker, and should function as a handy reference for developers and DevOps engineers.

I'll kick off this Docker cheat sheet with cleaning up Docker images, let's get started.

## Cleaning up Docker images

If you update your Docker container images regularly using something like [watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/), you might have dangling images which are out-of-date and no longer associated with some of your running containers.

So why not use `docker image prune` to reclaim that valuable disk space. For example, running this command on my Raspberry Pi shaved off about 9.66Gb of disk usage.

As a bonus, you can save some additional space using `docker image prune --all`, which removes all unused Docker images.

## Restarting all containers

Sometimes you want to restart all your containers at once, such as after you've pulled the latest images for your containers.

To do this, use `docker restart $(docker ps -q)`, this command instructs Docker to restart all containers using the container ids which are returned from `docker ps -q`.

## Stopping all containers

Need to stop all containers? Simply use `docker stop $(docker ps -q)`. As above, this uses the container ids from `docker ps` to stop each running container.
