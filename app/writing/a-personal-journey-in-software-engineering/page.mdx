Hello there!

If you're reading this, you've likely stumbled upon my website — welcome! My name is Ryan Freeman, and I'm a full-stack developer
with a passion for creating intuitive and dynamic web applications.

I have been working in the aviation industry for Aer Lingus since February 2022. My specialities include React, Java
and AWS technologies, and I have a strong focus on building scalable and reliable solutions.

This website is a showcase of my work, as well as a platform for me to share my thoughts and insights in the world of software engineering.
Here's what you can expect to find:

- A portfolio of my past and current projects, showcasing the range of applications I have developed and the technologies I have used.
- Blog posts on a variety of topics, from the latest trends in software engineering to my personal experiences and insights as a full-stack developer.
- Links to connect with me and to download my most up-to-date CV.

I hope that my website provides you with a glimpse into my world as a full-stack developer, and I invite you to explore and learn more about what I do.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope to hear from you soon!
