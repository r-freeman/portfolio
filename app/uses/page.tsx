                          href="https://hermanmiller.com/en_eur/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/">
                        I bought this chair second-hand when I started working for Apple, it&apos;s extremely comfortable and
                        ergonomic for those long hours spent at the desk.

                        I was on the fence about standing desks for a while but after some research I decided to give the
                        Maidesite T2 Pro Standing Desk Frame a try. This allows me to easily transition between sitting and
                        standing.

                        I use a mix of JetBrain apps for my IDEs depending on what I&apos;m working on. For JavaScript
                        projects, I use WebStorm. PyCharm for python and IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate for Java. I use the same
                        keyboard shortcuts across these apps which is great for productivity.

                        Good tool for designing and testing REST APIs. I used to use Postman but I found the interface too
                        cluttered and prefer the simplicity of Insomnia.

                        automating common tasks. For example, I use AutoHotKey to toggle between dark and light themes in
